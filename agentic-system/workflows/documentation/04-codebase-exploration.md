You are executing the documentation codebase exploration: gather the code evidence each placeholder directive asks for. This step is driven by the directives, not by curiosity.

## The instruments
- `#capability:codebase-clusters(WorkspacePath, fileExtension)` returns the **domain map** of the codebase: cluster name → size. `#capability:codebase-cluster-files(WorkspacePath, fileExtension, clusterName)` returns the **full paths** of one cluster.
- The map is an **exclusive partition with full coverage**: every source file of the codebase belongs to exactly one cluster. The map therefore answers "where can this component be?" without walking the file system.
- BOTH cluster tools — `#capability:codebase-clusters` and `#capability:codebase-cluster-files` — may be called as many times as the iteration needs.
- The file-system instruments — `bash`, `grep` and `glob` — may also be used as often as the exploration needs: there is no numeric budget and no cap on how many searches you run. Use them after the clusters, scoped to a subtree a cluster has already named.
- The `read` tool is restricted: a file may be read only if its path was returned by a cluster listing. No cluster listing, no read.
- Start every exploration with `#capability:codebase-clusters`: it is the FIRST action, not the last resort. The clusters move the effort onto the domain map, so you extract from the map what you would otherwise extract from a text search.

## The iteration protocol
Run the loop below as many times as the work needs. It is not a one-shot sequence; repeat it until the exploration is complete. "Good enough" is not a stop condition: the only stop conditions are the completion of the exploration or an explicit blocker.

1. **Pass A — Map.** Open the map with `#capability:codebase-clusters` and record it. Re-open it whenever you need the exact cluster names — for example before resolving a "not found" — because the cluster tools are free and may be repeated freely. Read cluster names as domain names and cluster sizes as scale.
2. **Pass B — Assign.** For each element of your work — the obligations of the design artifact, the directives of the documentation, the components the implementation needs — name the candidate clusters and why. Make the reasoning explicit: element → candidate clusters → why that domain can contain the component. Do not keep the assignment implicit.
3. **Pass C — Open.** Call `#capability:codebase-cluster-files` on every shortlisted cluster. Treat each returned path list as the **name index** of the domain: find the types and members whose names carry the element.
4. **Pass D — Resolve.** Every selected component's path must come from a cluster listing. Separate production code from test infrastructure (the `Tests` tier, `*Tests` files) and from contracts by reading their names.
5. **Pass E — Read.** Read only the selected files, declarations only (see the reading rule below), and never the body when a declaration states the mechanism.
6. **Pass F — Verify.** Check that every component your work names is anchored to a cluster path and that every gap or directive names its component. If a component is still unlocated, return to Pass B and open different clusters before reaching for `bash`/`grep`/`glob`. When the clusters cannot answer the question, run the file-system search scoped to a subtree a cluster has already named.

After Pass F, produce the outputs the including instruction defines (Pass G).

## The search rule
- `#capability:codebase-clusters` is the first action of an exploration; `bash`, `grep` and `glob` come after it, scoped to a subtree a cluster has already named, and they may be used as many times as needed.
- Each search invocation must be justified by a specific unresolved question the clusters could not answer. There is no obligation to combine localization and content dump into one command.
- The following uses are forbidden:
  - whole-workspace enumeration;
  - `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` over the workspace;
  - `git ls-files` or `rg --files` to discover areas;
  - listing directories merely to "see what is there";
  - re-running a search to verify what the cluster tools said;
  - substituting a search call for a failed cluster tool.
- If a search call fails, record what remains unknown as an open point or a gap, or as a blocker when it stops the exploration.

## Cluster-usage discipline
- Prefer locating a component by reasoning on the cluster name and on the file names inside it; a `bash`/`grep`/`glob` search supplements the clusters, it is never the first move.
- Cluster size is a scale signal, not a relevance proof. A large domain is where mechanisms concentrate; a small one is a leaf. Relevance comes from the work, never from the sound of the name.
- When an expected domain is absent from the map, that absence is itself evidence about the codebase: record it as an open point or a gap instead of searching for it.
- When `#capability:codebase-cluster-files` answers that a cluster name is not found, re-read the map and use the exact name returned by `#capability:codebase-clusters`; never fall back to a file-system search.
- The `Tests` and `General` low-confidence tiers are not domains: use them to find test infrastructure and residual files, never to infer a business boundary from them.

## Reading rule — declarations, not bodies
- Read a file ONLY if your work cannot proceed without it.
- Prefer the declaration surface — types, members, signatures, interfaces — over the implementation body. The exploration names the mechanism; it never re-derives it.
- Read a full body only for the few components whose behaviour the work must state, and never dump a whole file when you need one member.
- Never re-read a file, and never read a file your work does not need. When a question needs more reading than the components the work involves, it is a note, gap or open point, not a reason to read further.
- Do NOT follow dependency chains: do not read "the concrete implementation of a contract" or "the entity behind a facade" unless that file is one of the selected components.

## Failure arms
- `#capability:codebase-clusters` or `#capability:codebase-cluster-files` fails: retry the **cluster tool** once — retrying a cluster tool is free. If it still fails, state that the exploration cannot be completed, record a blocker and halt. A failed cluster tool is NEVER substituted by a `bash`, `grep` or `glob` call.
- A `read` of a selected file fails: retry once; if it still fails, record a blocker and halt.

**Rules**

1. **Directive-driven evidence.** For every placeholder directive that needs code evidence, gather exactly the evidence the directive asks for: an endpoint, an end-to-end flow, a component map, a root cause, a verbatim snippet, a configuration table. In Pass B, for every placeholder directive that needs code evidence, name the candidate clusters and why, exactly as the iteration protocol requires.

2. **Document, do not design.** Do not design and do not propose changes; you document what exists.

3. **Stop when grounded.** Stop as soon as every directive has its evidence. If a directive cannot be grounded in the code, record it and explain why in the final document.

---

**Grounding**

- Ground every fact in a `file:line` you actually saw; never emit file references in the document unless the user explicitly asks for them (see the authoring rules).
- The content comes from the `read` tool on a path returned by a cluster listing, and the line numbers come from that read.
- A directive that cannot be grounded is marked ungrounded and explained in the final document.
- The single `bash`/`grep`/`glob` invocation exists for a directive that cannot be satisfied from the cluster listings alone. A no-match means the directive is ungrounded (not a reason to search more).

**Output**

The evidence mapped to each placeholder directive.
